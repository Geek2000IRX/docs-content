## Introduction

We know that agricultural activities are normally carried out in remote environments, this makes access to electricity and connectivity a challenge. 

Smart farming techniques are being implemented more and more due to the importance of optimizing the use of resources. This includes the demand for more efficient, eco-friendly, and more profitable crops.

Implementing traditional wired communication infrastructure in remote areas can be expensive and time-consuming. LoRaWAN, being a wireless technology, provides a cost-effective alternative as it requires minimal infrastructure setup, reducing installation and maintenance costs.

Arduino has you covered in these scenarios with its Pro solutions. With products designed to work in remote environments, supplying their power from renewable sources and providing long-distance connectivity and low power consumption.

The shown application note is intended to replicate a scaled smart farming application, that can be implemented on real agriculture fields using the same hardware and firmware.
